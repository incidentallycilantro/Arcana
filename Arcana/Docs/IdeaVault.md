# 💡 PrivateLLMCompanion – Idea Vault

This file is the long-term memory for spontaneous ideas, feature sparks, UX thoughts, and "what if..." moments. Ideas logged here are NOT discarded — they are reviewed and prioritized during planning.

---

## 🔥 High-Priority Candidates (Under Review)
- "Resume Last Session" button with context restoration
- Timeline scrubber to rewind and re-branch any conversation thread
- Chat forking that visually maps to a branching tree UI
- Assistant avatar that reacts dynamically (e.g. glows when model switches)
- “Intelligent Clipboard”: paste a copied message and assistant offers to summarize, rewrite, etc.

---

## 🧠 UX & Interaction Ideas
- Drop a file → animated inline options appear: “Summarize”, “Extract Action Items”, “Convert to Markdown”
- Model switch shown by a ripple effect or assistant voice tone shift
- Assistant learns and adapts tone over time (“Creative” vs “Technical” modes)
- “AI as Co-Author” mode: writes full posts, not just responses

---

## ⚙️ PRISM Engine Concepts
- Adaptive quantization tuner: compress model if device is low on disk
- Federated adapter sync via local LAN (trusted mesh mode)
- Model “session warming”: load likely shard segments in background based on usage patterns

---

## 🧪 Experimental or Future Exploration
- Voice-first interface with conversational flow
- LoRA skill trainer UI: use a few samples to train a custom task
- Live embedded diagram generation from Markdown or text
- Local GPT-V-like image interpreter for vision tasks (future hardware)
