# Assistant Thread Management Guide

To avoid overloading the current thread:

## 🧵 Start a New Thread When:
- You begin building a **new major feature** (e.g., PRISM memory, file ingestion)
- You want to **brainstorm big ideas** not directly tied to the current task
- A thread starts slowing down, or responses seem inconsistent

## 🧠 When You Start a New Thread:
Include this template:
Project: Private LLM Companion
Current Focus: [e.g. File Ingestion UX]
Previous Focus: [e.g. ChatView Forking]
Summary: We are building a macOS app with a local LLM engine (PRISM). This thread continues where the last left off.

##  If You’re Ever Lost:
Just ask: “Where were we?”  
I’ll instantly recap:
- ✅ Last thing completed
- 🔧 Current focus
- 🧠 Ideas parked for later
